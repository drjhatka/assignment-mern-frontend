## 🚧 Challenges
Building an online bike shop comes with several challenges, including:

### 1. User Authentication & Security
**Implementing a secure registration/login system while protecting user data.**

**Handling password encryption, session management, and preventing unauthorized access.**

### 2. Product Management
**Organizing bikes into different categories (e.g., Mountain, Road, Hybrid) with filters (price, brand, size).**

**Managing inventory to prevent overselling (real-time stock updates).**

### 3. Payment Integration
**Integrating a reliable payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal, etc.) while ensuring PCI compliance.**

 **Handling refunds, failed transactions, and fraud detection.**

### 4. Responsive & Accessible UI
**Designing a mobile-friendly interface for seamless shopping across devices.**

**Ensuring fast load times and smooth navigation despite high-resolution bike images.**

### 5. Order & Shipping Management
**Tracking orders, generating invoices, and updating customers on delivery status.**
