## 🚧 Challenges
Building an online bike shop comes with several challenges, including:

### 1. User Authentication & Security
** Implementing a secure registration/login system while protecting user data.**

** Handling password encryption, session management, and preventing unauthorized access.**

2. Product Management
Organizing bikes into different categories (e.g., Mountain, Road, Hybrid) with filters (price, brand, size).

Managing inventory to prevent overselling (real-time stock updates).

3. Payment Integration
Integrating a reliable payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal, etc.) while ensuring PCI compliance.

Handling refunds, failed transactions, and fraud detection.

4. Responsive & Accessible UI
Designing a mobile-friendly interface for seamless shopping across devices.

Ensuring fast load times and smooth navigation despite high-resolution bike images.

5. Order & Shipping Management
Tracking orders, generating invoices, and updating customers on delivery status.

Calculating accurate shipping costs based on location and bike dimensions.

6. Performance Optimization
Handling high traffic during promotions without slowing down the site.
